Apache configuration.
We adjust the apache config, so that each domain has it's own public folder.
This is so that we can grant ftp access, and perform caching on a per site basis.

Add in *PassengerAppRoot* attribute, see example below.

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName client.local
  DocumentRoot "/sites/client-a/public"
  PassengerAppRoot "/apps/photo"
  <Directory "/sites/client-a/public">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
